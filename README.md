Credit Card Approval Prediction


Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank is able to decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant. Credit scores can objectively quantify the magnitude of risk.


### Our Project [Predicting Good & Bad Customers for Credit Cards]

The main motive of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client. different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task
